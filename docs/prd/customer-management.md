## Overview

The Customer Management feature allows users to create, view, edit, and delete customer records in the CRM system. It provides a comprehensive view of customer information, including contact details, order history, and notes.

## Problem Statement

Sales and support teams need a centralized system to manage customer information. Without this, customer data is scattered across different systems, leading to inefficiencies, duplicate records, and poor customer service. The Customer Management feature solves this by providing a single source of truth for customer data.

## Goals and Success Metrics

### Goals

- Provide a comprehensive view of customer information
- Enable efficient creation and management of customer records
- Link customers to their order history
- Support search and filtering of customer records

### Success Metrics

- **User Adoption**: 90% of sales team using the system daily
- **Data Completeness**: 95% of customer records have complete information
- **Efficiency**: Reduce time to find customer information by 50%
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Improve customer satisfaction scores by 15%

## User Experience

### Customer List View

The main customer list view displays all customers in a table format with the following columns:
- Customer Name (clickable to view details)
- TIN
- Customer Since (date)
- Address
- Primary Contact
- Status
- Actions (Edit, Delete)

A search bar at the top allows filtering by name or TIN. Pagination is implemented for large datasets.

### Customer Detail View

The customer detail view is divided into sections:
1. **Basic Information**: Name, TIN, customer type, etc.
2. **Contact Information**: Email, phone, etc.
3. **Address Information**: Street, city, state, etc.
4. **Order History**: List of orders placed by the customer
5. **Notes**: Additional information about the customer

### Customer Form

The form for creating/editing customers includes fields for:
- Name (required)
- TIN (formatted as XXX-XXX-XXX)
- Customer Type (individual/business)
- Address Information
- Contact Information

## Technical Considerations

- Customer data is stored in MongoDB using Mongoose
