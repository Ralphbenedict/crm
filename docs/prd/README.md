# Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)

This directory contains the Product Requirements Documents for the CRM system.

## What is a PRD?

A PRD is a document that outlines the requirements, features, and functionality of a product or feature. It serves as a reference for the development team, designers, and stakeholders.

## PRD Structure

Each PRD follows this structure:

1. **Overview** - Brief description of the feature/product
2. **Problem Statement** - The problem this feature solves
3. **Goals and Success Metrics** - How we'll measure success
4. **User Stories** - Detailed user stories (with links to the user stories directory)
5. **Requirements** - Functional and non-functional requirements
6. **User Experience** - User flow and interaction details
7. **Technical Considerations** - Any technical constraints or considerations
8. **Timeline** - Expected development timeline
9. **Future Considerations** - Potential future enhancements
