# Milestone: Order Management Enhancements

**Version:** v2.0  
**Timeline:** June 1, 2024 to July 15, 2024  
**Status:** Planning  
**Owner:** Ralph Bautista

## Overview

This milestone focuses on enhancing the order management capabilities of our CRM system to improve efficiency, accuracy, and user experience. We'll introduce advanced order tracking, streamlined order creation, and improved reporting to help sales and operations teams manage customer orders more effectively.

## Goals

- Reduce order processing time by 30%
- Improve order accuracy and reduce errors by 50%
- Enhance visibility into order status and history
- Streamline the order creation process for sales representatives

## Success Criteria

- Average order processing time reduced from 10 minutes to 7 minutes or less
- Order error rate reduced from 5% to 2.5% or less
- 90% of users report improved satisfaction with order management features
- Order creation process requires 30% fewer clicks/steps

## Features and Deliverables

| Feature | Priority | PRD Link | Status |
|---------|----------|----------|--------|
| Streamlined Order Creation | High | [Order Creation PRD](../prd/order-creation.md) | Not Started |
| Advanced Order Tracking | High | [Order Tracking PRD](../prd/order-tracking.md) | Not Started |
| Order History & Analytics | Medium | [Order Analytics PRD](../prd/order-analytics.md) | Not Started |
| Bulk Order Operations | Low | [Bulk Operations PRD](../prd/bulk-operations.md) | Not Started |

## User Impact

Sales representatives will benefit from a more intuitive order creation process, reducing training time and errors. Operations teams will gain better visibility into order status and history, enabling them to respond more quickly to customer inquiries. Management will have access to improved analytics for better decision-making. Overall, these enhancements will lead to faster order processing, fewer errors, and improved customer satisfaction.

## Technical Considerations

- We'll need to refactor the Order model to support new tracking states
- The order creation form will be rebuilt using a multi-step wizard approach
- We'll implement a new analytics engine for order reporting
- Database optimizations will be needed to support faster queries on large order datasets
- API endpoints will need to be updated to support new order operations

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Plan |
|------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Data migration complexity | High | Medium | Develop a detailed migration plan with rollback options; test thoroughly in staging |
| User resistance to new workflow | Medium | Medium | Involve key users in design; provide training and documentation; phase rollout |
| Performance issues with large order volumes | High | Low | Implement database optimizations; conduct load testing; add caching where appropriate |
| Integration issues with existing systems | Medium | Medium | Identify all integration points early; create comprehensive test plan; maintain backward compatibility |

## Dependencies

- Completion of Customer Management enhancements (previous milestone)
- MongoDB performance optimizations
- Updated UI component library
- User feedback from current order process
