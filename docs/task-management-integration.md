# Task Management Integration

This document explains how to integrate the PRDs and user stories with your task management system (e.g., GitHub Issues, Jira, Trello, etc.).

## Linking Documentation to Tasks

### 1. Creating Tasks from User Stories

Each user story should be converted into one or more tasks in your task management system:

1. Create a new task/issue
2. Use the user story title as the task title
3. In the description, include:
   - Link to the user story document
   - Copy of the acceptance criteria
   - Any technical notes relevant to implementation
4. Add appropriate labels/tags (feature category, priority, etc.)
5. Assign to the appropriate team member or leave unassigned for sprint planning

### 2. Task Naming Convention

Use a consistent naming convention for tasks:

```
[Feature] User Story Title
```

For example:
- `[Customer] Create New Customer`
- `[Order] View Order Details`
- `[Cost] Calculate Laser Cutting Cost`

### 3. Task References

In your commit messages and pull requests, reference the task ID:

```
git commit -m "Implement customer creation form (fixes #123)"
```

### 4. Task Status Updates

As development progresses, update both:
- The task status in your task management system
- The status field in the user story document

### 5. Definition of Done

A task is considered "Done" when:
- All acceptance criteria are met
- Code is reviewed and approved
- Tests are written and passing
- Documentation is updated
- The feature is deployed to staging/production

## GitHub Issues Integration

If using GitHub Issues:

1. Create issue templates that match your user story format
2. Use GitHub Projects for sprint/kanban boards
3. Use labels to categorize issues by feature, priority, etc.
4. Use milestones to group issues into releases

Example GitHub Issue template:

```markdown
## User Story
As a [type of user], I want to [perform some action], so that [achieve some goal/benefit].

## Acceptance Criteria
1. 
2. 
3. 

## Technical Notes
- 

## Related Documents
- User Story: [link]
- PRD: [link]
- Design: [link]
```

## Jira Integration

If using Jira:

1. Create a custom issue type for "User Story"
2. Add custom fields for acceptance criteria, effort, etc.
3. Link issues to Confluence pages containing PRDs and detailed user stories
4. Use epics to group related user stories

## Trello Integration

If using Trello:

1. Create a board for each feature or sprint
2. Use cards for user stories
3. Add checklists for acceptance criteria
4. Use labels for priority and status
5. Attach links to PRD and user story documents

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Planning Phase**:
   - Create/update PRD
   - Break down into user stories
   - Create tasks in task management system

2. **Development Phase**:
   - Assign tasks during sprint planning
   - Reference task IDs in commits and PRs
   - Update task status as work progresses

3. **Review Phase**:
   - Verify all acceptance criteria are met
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Close tasks when complete

4. **Retrospective**:
   - Review completed user stories
   - Update PRDs with lessons learned
   - Plan next iteration
