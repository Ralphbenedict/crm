# Milestone Planning Guide

This guide explains how to plan and document new milestones for the CRM project, ensuring they integrate seamlessly with our PRD and user story structure.

## What is a Milestone?

In our project, a milestone represents a significant phase or release with a specific set of features and objectives. Milestones help us:

- Break down the project into manageable chunks
- Set clear goals and timelines
- Track progress effectively
- Communicate plans to stakeholders

## Milestone Planning Process

### 1. Define the Milestone

Start by defining the milestone's scope and objectives:

1. **Identify the theme** - What's the central focus? (e.g., "Customer Management Enhancements")
2. **Set timeline** - When will it start and end?
3. **Establish goals** - What specific outcomes do you want to achieve?
4. **Define success criteria** - How will you measure success?

### 2. Create the Milestone Overview Document

Use the [milestone overview template](./templates/milestone-overview.md) to create a new document:

1. Copy the template to `docs/milestones/[milestone-name].md`
2. Fill in all sections of the template
3. Be specific about goals and success criteria
4. Link to existing PRDs or note which ones need to be created

### 3. Plan Features and PRDs

For each feature in the milestone:

1. **Create or update PRDs** - Use the [PRD template](./prd/template.md)
2. **Link PRDs in the milestone document** - Update the Features table
3. **Prioritize features** - Mark as High/Medium/Low priority

### 4. Break Down into User Stories

For each feature:

1. **Create user stories** - Use the [user story template](./user-stories/template.md)
2. **Organize by feature** - Place in appropriate feature subdirectory
3. **Link to PRDs** - Ensure each user story references its PRD

### 5. Create Tasks in Task Management System

1. **Create an epic or milestone** in your task management system
2. **Add tasks for each user story** - Link to the user story document
3. **Set priorities and assignees** - Based on the milestone plan

## Example Workflow

Here's how the process works in practice:

1. **Product Manager decides** to plan a "Customer Management Enhancements" milestone
2. **Creates milestone overview document** using the template
3. **Identifies three features** to include:
   - Advanced customer search
   - Customer segmentation
   - Customer notes and history
4. **Creates/updates PRDs** for each feature
5. **Breaks down features** into user stories
6. **Sets up the milestone** in the task management system
7. **Links everything together** for full traceability

## Integration with Development Process

Once the milestone is planned:

1. **Kick-off meeting** - Review the milestone plan with the team
2. **Sprint planning** - Pull user stories into sprints based on priority
3. **Regular updates** - Update the milestone document as progress is made
4. **Milestone review** - Evaluate against success criteria when complete

## Tips for Effective Milestone Planning

1. **Be realistic about scope** - It's better to accomplish fewer features well than to overcommit
2. **Involve the team** - Get input from developers, designers, and other stakeholders
3. **Consider dependencies** - Identify and plan for both internal and external dependencies
4. **Build in buffer time** - Allow for unexpected challenges
5. **Update regularly** - Keep the milestone document current as things change

## Milestone Documentation Structure

Organize milestone documentation as follows:

```
/docs
  /milestones
    milestone-1.md
    milestone-2.md
    current-milestone.md
  /prd
    /feature-1
      feature-1-prd.md
    /feature-2
      feature-2-prd.md
  /user-stories
    /feature-1
      story-1.md
      story-2.md
    /feature-2
      story-3.md
      story-4.md
```

## Milestone Review Process

After completing a milestone:

1. **Review against success criteria** - Did you meet the defined metrics?
2. **Document lessons learned** - What went well? What could be improved?
3. **Update documentation** - Ensure PRDs and user stories reflect what was actually built
4. **Plan next milestone** - Use insights to inform the next milestone plan
