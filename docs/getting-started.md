# Getting Started with PRDs and User Stories

This guide will help you get started with using Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and user stories in the CRM project.

## Introduction

We've implemented a structured approach to documentation and task management using PRDs and user stories. This approach helps:

- Provide clear context for development tasks
- Ensure everyone understands the requirements
- Track progress effectively
- Maintain a record of decisions and rationale

## Key Documents

Start by familiarizing yourself with these key documents:

1. [Documentation Structure](./README.md) - Overview of the documentation system
2. [PRD Guide](./prd/README.md) - Information about Product Requirements Documents
3. [User Stories Guide](./user-stories/README.md) - Information about user stories
4. [Task Management Integration](./task-management-integration.md) - How to link docs to tasks
5. [Developer Guide](./developer-guide.md) - How to use these docs in development

## Quick Start

### For Product Managers / Project Owners

1. **Creating a New Feature**:
   - Start by creating a PRD using the [template](./prd/template.md)
   - Break down the feature into user stories
   - Create user story documents using the [template](./user-stories/template.md)
   - Link the PRD and user stories together

2. **Planning Development**:
   - Create tasks in your task management system based on user stories
   - Prioritize tasks based on business value and dependencies
   - Assign tasks to developers or leave for sprint planning

### For Developers

1. **Starting a New Task**:
   - Read the associated PRD and user story
   - Understand all acceptance criteria
   - Plan your implementation approach

2. **During Development**:
   - Reference the documentation regularly
   - Update task status as you progress
   - Ask questions if requirements are unclear

3. **Completing a Task**:
   - Verify all acceptance criteria are met
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Create a pull request referencing the task

## Example Workflow

Here's a complete example of how this system works:

1. **Product Manager**:
   - Creates a PRD for "Customer Management"
   - Breaks it down into user stories like "Create Customer", "View Customer List", etc.
   - Creates tasks in the task management system

2. **Developer**:
   - Is assigned the "Create Customer Form" task
   - Reviews the PRD and user story
   - Implements the feature according to acceptance criteria
   - Creates a pull request referencing the task

3. **Reviewer**:
   - Reviews the code against the acceptance criteria
   - Approves the changes or requests modifications

4. **Product Manager**:
   - Verifies the feature meets the requirements
   - Marks the user story as complete
   - Updates the PRD status if all related stories are complete
